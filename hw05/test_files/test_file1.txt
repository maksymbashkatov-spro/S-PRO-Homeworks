Musk was born to White South African parents in Pretoria, where he grew up.
He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.
He matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in Economics and Physics.
He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal.
The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999.
The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.
The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
